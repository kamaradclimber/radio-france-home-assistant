Contributions are very welcome!

For new features, please take time to open an issue first to describe what you would like to see and why.

For bug fixes, also make sure there is an existing issue tracking the issue and how to reproduce it.

Contribution language is in English, good commit messages will be appreciated as well as clean git history (self-contained commit, no "fixup" commit).

If you are not very comfortable with coding, that's fine! Mention it in the PR and someone will guide you to improve the PR (or will take over the code to improve it if you prefer).


Note: this repo uses https://gitmoji.dev/ so if you like to add emojis in your commit message, go ahead!
