## Installation

It must be used as a custom repository via hacs.

## Configuration

Once the custom integration has been added, add `radio_france` integration through the UI.

You need an api key, see https://developers.radiofrance.fr/doc for details.

FIP (and other music-only stations) is a special case and thus is not [supported yet](https://github.com/kamaradclimber/radio-france-home-assistant/issues/1).
